# Update design

Inspect the existing implementation and rendered state before editing. Preserve
the component's intended behavior and public contract unless the user requests
otherwise. Apply the project-specific guidelines below, then compare the result
with the prior state at relevant sizes and in every supported theme. When Hexby
component tools are available, capture the current state, wait for refresh, and
inspect the after screenshot.

If the user's request conflicts with a hard project-specific guideline, raise
the conflict with the user before making changes and link them to [project
guideline settings](#hexby-guidelines) so they can review it.
